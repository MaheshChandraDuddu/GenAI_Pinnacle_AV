Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the\\nUnited States since 1886, are now sold in more than \\n200\\n countries.\\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution\\noperations as well as independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers — the world\\'s largest beverage distribution system. Beverages bearing trademarks\\nowned by or licensed to us account for more than \\n1.9 billion\\n of the approximately \\n58 billion\\n servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. Our\\nsuccess further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.\\nOur goal is to use our Company\\'s assets — our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management\\nand associates — to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners.\\nWe were incorporated in September 1919 under the laws of the State of Delaware and succeeded to the business of a Georgia corporation with the same name that had been\\norganized in 1892.\\n1', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]"

However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not\\nmean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future —\\nincluding statements relating to volume growth, share of sales and earnings per share growth, and statements expressing general views about future operating results — are\\nforward-looking statements. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place\\nundue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. Our Company undertakes no obligation to publicly\\nupdate or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking\\nstatements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our Company\\'s historical experience and our present\\nexpectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in Part I, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this report and\\nthose described from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\n \\nPART I\\n \\nITEM 1.    BUSINESS\\nIn this report, the terms \"The Coca-Cola Company,\" \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial\\nstatements.\\nGeneral\\nThe Coca-Cola Company is the world\\'s largest beverage company. We own or license and market more than \\n500\\n nonalcoholic beverage brands, primarily sparkling beverages\\nbut also a variety of still beverages such as waters, enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and energy and sports drinks. We own and market\\nfour\\n of the world\\'s top five nonalcoholic sparkling beverage brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the\\nUnited States since 1886, are now sold in more than \\n200\\n countries.\\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution\\noperations as well as independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers — the world\\'s largest beverage distribution system. Beverages bearing trademarks\\nowned by or licensed to us account for more than \\n1.9 billion\\n of the approximately \\n58 billion\\n servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. Our\\nsuccess further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.\\nOur goal is to use our Company\\'s assets — our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management\\nand associates — to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners.\\nWe were incorporated in September 1919 under the laws of the State of Delaware and succeeded to the business of a Georgia corporation with the same name that had been\\norganized in 1892.\\n1', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')"
